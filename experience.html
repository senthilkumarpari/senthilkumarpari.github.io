              <p style="text-align:center; "><font size="4 ">Abstract</font> </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify; "> Characterization of fuel droplet evaporation and burning in a turbulent flow field is of high practical importance in applications such as pre-vaporizers, diesel engines, gas turbine combustors and liquid fuel-fed furnaces. The spray droplets are often embedded in a gas-phase turbulent flow with varying turbulence intensities and scales, with respect to spatial location and time. Hence, the evaporation and burning rates of the droplets are strongly dependent on the turbulence parameters. The turbulence fluctuations caused by eddies smaller than the drop size may directly alter the heat and mass transport processes between the droplet and the surrounding gas-phase. The present study experimentally investigates the evaporation and burning rates of isolated fuel droplets kept in a well characterized turbulent air flow field. A controlled turbulent flow has been generated using grids of large solidity ratios, kept in flush at the exit plane of a round jet nozzle. The measurements of turbulence parameters have been performed using a hot-wire anemometer. A suspended droplet technique is used to investigate the effects of turbulence intensity and scales on the evaporation characteristics.  Correlations have been proposed for the evaporation rate in terms of turbulence intensity and Taylor scale. The effects of turbulence on the burning characteristics of isolated droplets are investigated using the suspended droplet and porous sphere techniques. Droplets of methanol (alcohol) and n-heptane (hydrocarbon) have been used. All the experiments have been conducted in normal gravity and atmospheric pressure.

                        <p style="text-align:justify; "> <font color="yellow " size="4 "> Cheif Project Investigator: Rajasekhar, M.Tech, IIT Madras.</font> </p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify; "> Grids are generally employed to control the level of turbulent fluctuations inside a wind tunnel. However, their application in controlling turbulence of open free jet is quite restricted. The transition to turbulence is merely governed by the instabilities of the large scale vortical structures inherent in any shear flows. Employing grids at the exit of a nozzle issuing air jet are believed to alter these structures.  In the present study, smoke wire technique is used in order to visualise the large scale structures present in the shear layer of a jet.  A stream of high density smoke is generated from vaporized silicone oil applied to an electrically heated nichrome wire. The streak lines of smoke along the flow are illuminated using a halogen lamp and are captured using a high speed camera.  The series of images obtained are processed using Matlab to find the vortex passing frequencies. The flow field characterization is done using a single component hot wire anemometer. The vortex passing frequencies obtained through photographs are validated against hot-wire data obtained by placing the probe at appropriate locations in the jet shear layer.  The visualizations studies as well as the hot-wire measurements are carried out for three cases, viz.,   free jet, a free jet case with coarse grid and a free jet with a fine grid. Experiments are carried out in a specially designed low turbulence open wind tunnel issuing an axisymmetric jet. The experiments are conducted for three Reynolds number. Smaller Reynolds number near transition has been chosen, as it is reported in literature that the large scale structures are more dominant and easy to visualize.

</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify; ">Flow visualization has always been an important tool in fluid dynamics research and has been used extensively. For instance,  in engineering, physics, metrology, oceanography to name a few. One of the main reasons for its extensive usage is unlike other techniques, which are limited to measuring flow conditions at some particular point at a time within flow field; flow visualization techniques are capable of yielding a more qualitative macroscopic picture of the overall flow field.  Smoke streaks are one of the few cheap but effective visualization technique widely used inside large wind tunnels to visualize flow around complex aerodynamic structures. There are few studies were the smoke streaks are used in open jets to visualize the vortical structures in shear layers. This technique though employed in free axisymmetric and plane jets, has never been employed when grids are mounted in free jets. The exact sciences of how the grids affect the flow patterns are not clear. To confirm the visualization studies quantatively, a hot-wire anemometer is used.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left; "><font size="4 "> Experimental Setup</font> </p>

<p style="text-align:justify; "> Pre experimental work is completely dedicated to building the set-up.  A vertical wind tunnel issuing a round axisymmetric air jet is designed and fabricated. The wind tunnel consists of a long conical diffuser at the bottom connected to a metallic vertical tube and a convergent nozzle of exit diameter (D) equal 55mm. There are series of flow straighteners, meshes coarse to fine installed inside the wind tunnel to make the turbulent intensity of the jet as small as possible. The detailed design of the setup is given in the report.
Experiments are conducted in two phases 1) Visualization 2) Hot wire measurements.
To visualize the flow patterns, smoke wire technique has been adopted. In smoke wire technique, a thin, electrically heated nichrome wire is stretched and held at about few mm from the jet nozzle exit.  A smoke screen is generated from vaporized silicone oil applied to nichrome wire. The density and duration of smoke generation depends mainly on the voltage across the nichrome wire. So an electrical circuit is designed and fabricated in our institute to control the current passing through the wire. The smoke streaks are illuminated using a 500W yellow halogen lamp and a reflector made of thermocole. All the videos are  captured using a high speed camera (FASTEC) set to record at a frame rate of 300.  The images obtained are then processed in MATLAB. The RGB images are converted to gray scale images from which the variation of intensity at four different locations, viz., 0.5D, 1D, 2D and 3D  are obtained with respect to time.  The data obtained in time domain is transformed to the frequency domain using a Fast Fourier Transform function inbuilt in MATLAB.  Same procedure has been followed for the two mesh cases.
The second part of the project included validation of results obtained from visualization technique using hot wire anemometer.  A Dantec made mini-CTA, is used to obtain the instantaneous velocity fluctuations in the shear layer. The hotwire is calibrated using a vertical wind tunnel and a pitot tube connected to a micro-manometer. Once the transform function is known from suitable curve fitting, the jet is checked for axisymmetry at about 0.5D. Both free jet and jet mounted with grids are found to be axisymmetric except for few undulations in coarse grid cases which eventually dies at 1D distance from the nozzle exit.  The stream-wise turbulent intensities measured near the inlet are below 2% of the mean velocity incurred in the flow. Once the characterization is finished, the probe is placed at different axial locations in the shear layer. The data were sampled for 300,000 samples at rate of 20 kHz frequency (about 15 s).
 </p>
 <p style="text-align:left; "><font size="4 "> Results</font> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify; "> As the experiments were conducted with three different flow rates, only the flow corresponding to Re<sub>D</sub>=2240 is discussed below while the report includes all three cases. The following are the smoke screen images extracted from videos taken with the high speed camera at 300 fps. The background scale indicates the position in terms of axial distance (D) estimated from the nozzle exit. The streak lines are smooth leaving no traces of smoke smudges at the shear layer. But in grid mounted case streaks are wiggly. It is found that in case of coarse grids, the grids themselves cause the smoke streaks to oscillate.  The large scale structures in grid mounted case are being formed in the shear layer zone but still the central core region remains unaffected by the events in the edge of the shear layer. But in case of free je the unstable structures affect the central core region.  The following are the plots depicting the frequency variation for different cases at Re<sub>D</sub> =2240 probed at  0.5D, 1D, 2D and 3D. </p>
