              <p style="text-align:center;"><font size="4">Abstract</font> </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;"> Characterization of fuel droplet evaporation and burning in a turbulent flow field is of high practical importance in applications such as pre-vaporizers, diesel engines, gas turbine combustors and liquid fuel-fed furnaces. The spray droplets are often embedded in a gas-phase turbulent flow with varying turbulence intensities and scales, with respect to spatial location and time. Hence, the evaporation and burning rates of the droplets are strongly dependent on the turbulence parameters. The turbulence fluctuations caused by eddies smaller than the drop size may directly alter the heat and mass transport processes between the droplet and the surrounding gas-phase. The present study experimentally investigates the evaporation and burning rates of isolated fuel droplets kept in a well characterized turbulent air flow field. A controlled turbulent flow has been generated using grids of large solidity ratios, kept in flush at the exit plane of a round jet nozzle. The measurements of turbulence parameters have been performed using a hot-wire anemometer. A suspended droplet technique is used to investigate the effects of turbulence intensity and scales on the evaporation characteristics.  Correlations have been proposed for the evaporation rate in terms of turbulence intensity and Taylor scale. The effects of turbulence on the burning characteristics of isolated droplets are investigated using the suspended droplet and porous sphere techniques. Droplets of methanol (alcohol) and n-heptane (hydrocarbon) have been used. All the experiments have been conducted in normal gravity and atmospheric pressure.

                <p style="text-align:center;"><font size="4"> Extended Abstract</font></p>
                 <p style="text-align:justify;"> Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel that will replace  all petroleum products  in the future. Currently,  India is the third largest producer of coal contributing 7.4% of total  world’s coal production. Coal accounts for 55% of India's energy needs of which 75% is consumed by the power sector. The current way  of extracting power from coal is highly inefficient and causes a threat to environment  by emitting  harmful pollutants.  Gasification of  coal is a classical method  that has played a major role in the clean combustion of coal.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> An advanced version known as the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (I.G.C.C)  is one of the  new invention that has attracted several industries using coal as their primary  input.  Gasification plays a major role in this methodology  and needs more attention.
Gasification reactions consist of both homogeneous and  heterogeneous steps.  These  reactions may be exothermic or endothermic. Unfortunately during gasification  endothermic reactions overweigh exothermic reactions  creating an energy depravation. In order to continue the reaction a constant energy source supplying the necessary energy for the endothermic reactions is required. Wall heating,  initial preheating of inlet air  and pilot burners  are a few of these methods employed in industries to provide the energy required for sustaining the gasification reactions. It has been noted that not much literature is available specifically, for  analyzing  the effect of pilot fuel on the gasification characteristics  of  pulverized high ash Indian sub bituminous coal.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In  present study, the effect of  pilot fuel (LPG)  and the input parameters such as air and steam ratios on atmospheric pressure gasification are investigated  through numerical simulations and the predictions are validated with experimental results.
Numerical modeling  is  proved to be one of the major tools for generating the necessary details of the gasification characteristics even  before the prototype of gasifier  is erected.  Numerical investigations along with the detailed combustion process analysis   can be used  to improve the  gasifier performance. A  gasifier operating with  different  mass flow rates  of pilot fuel  are compared numerically with a  gasifier operating with  constant wall heating. For  this analysis a 16 kW  capacity gasifier  is considered. A steady state  axi-symmetric model is developed and analyzed using FLUENT 6.3 software. The model consists of devolatilisation, combustion of volatiles, char combustion and gasification and other gas phase reactions. The continuous (gas) phase conservation equations are solved in an Eulerian frame and those of the particle phase are solved in a Lagrangian frame, with coupling between the two phases carried out through interactive source terms. The dispersion of the particles due to turbulence is predicted using a stochastic tracking model, in conjunction with the gas phase turbulent models (mainly the k-ε model). The effect of ash in the coal is assessed by suitably modifying the pre-exponential factor and diffusion rate constant in char reaction steps.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The effects of  LPG (pilot fuel )on the gasification characteristics, specifically the gasifier temperature, CO, H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O mole fractions, are assessed. The simulation for this case is done with four LPG mass flow rates corresponding to 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% of total gasifier power. The experiments were conducted in a 1m length , 72mm diameter  horizontal, tubular gasifier with LPG as pilot fuel, operating at atmospheric pressure. Several runs of experiment with different LPG flow rates and air ratio (the ratio of actual flow rate of air to stoichiometric air) corresponding to 0.30  were conducted. During the runs, no steam was allowed to enter the gasifier.  The experimental values obtained are thus compared with numerically simulated results. It was found that the mole fraction of CO is decreasing with the increasing mass flow rates of LPG. But  H<sub>2</sub> mole fraction increased with LPG mass flow rate. The sensitivity of different devolatilisation models  on gasification was found and  compared with the experimental data.</p>

 <p style="text-align:justify;">The  2-Step Kobayashi model showed a good agreement with experimental data. The effects of air ratio on gasification are determined for pilot  assisted gasification as well as the no pilot case numerically. In the pilot case, the CO mole fraction  at the exit of the gasifier is reduced and it  becomes almost nil for the air ratio of  0.45. The H<sub>2</sub> mole fraction increases  for the air ratios of 0.30, 0.35, 0.40 and slightly decreases with  air ratio of 0.45, similar  observations were seen in the no pilot case. The effect of steam on H<sub>2</sub> and CO was investigated in the no pilot case. It was found that H<sub>2</sub> mole fraction increased more rapidly but for higher steam flow rate it reduces due to flame quenching and incomplete combustion. The effect of air ratio and steam ratio on parameters like carbon conversion, higher heating value of product gas and cold gas efficiency  were found out. It was found that the carbon conversion increases with air ratio, but the higher heating value of the product gas decreases along with the cold gas efficiency. At higher steam ratios the carbon conversion increases along with the cold gas efficiency. But the changes are very small indicating steam has only a minor influence on these parameters.

                <h3 class="title"> <font size="6">Gas turbine swirl combustion</font> <span class="year"></span></h3>
                  <p style="text-align:center;"><font size="4"> Extended Abstract</font> </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Numerical Simulation can help in reducing the time and money spent to understand the intricacies of combustion processes inside a gas turbine combustor chamber. Geometry of combustor simulated in the present study is a 2D axis-symmetric model with fuel and primary air inlets and a concentric ring of dilution air. Swirl flow has been generated and analyzed in the annulus region by introducing primary air with axial and tangential velocity.

  <p style="text-align:justify;">Turbulence is modeled using RNG k-ε, with swirl dominated, standard wall function and an unstructured mesh is employed. Mole fraction of reacting species, NO<sub>X</sub> and temperature has been analyzed with changes in critical parameters while keeping all other variables constant. These parameters were swirl intensity, temperature of inlet air and ratio of primary to secondary air. Their effect was studied on fuel mixing, flame structure and combustion dynamics.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">It is observed that swirl helps in better mixing of the fuel and air, which in turn enhances the combustion process. Also, after a critical point, further increase in swirl does not alter the combustion and flame structure much. High and low values of primary to secondary air combustion show narrow reaction zones; hence an intermediate value is favored. NOX formation increases swirl intensities. Higher air inlet temperatures enhance the formation of thermal NO<sub>X</sub>.</p>

                             <p style="text-align:center;"><font size="4">Abstract</font> </p>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;"> This study presents digital image analysis of piloted partially premixed flames of Re = 1482 issuing from
a tubular burner. Flame images captured by a digital camera are processed by a MATLAB(TM) code. Axial pixel intensity plots obtained for stoichiometric and two fuel-rich flames without and with steam added to the main fuel-air mixture stream were analyzed. Steam addition is seen to alter flame structure markedly.
With increase in steam flow rate, flame brightness is seen to reduce considerably: also, this was accompanied by increase in the flame height. Distinct yellow-tipping flame zone is seen to occur for percentage primary aeration, %PA< 60%. The overall flame height including the yellow-tipping zone increased at a slower rate compared to the flames without yellow-tipping. Higher value of steam flow rate led to flame-tip opening. The flame height data obtained suggest that a correlating equation can be evolved in terms of % PA and steam flow rate.
